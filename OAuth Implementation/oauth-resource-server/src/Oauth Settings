This file is for the steps for implementing Authorization Server (Keycloak) and Resource Server
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementing Keycloak
---------------------
1. Goto keycloak bin directory and open cmd there
    c:\keycloak\bin>


    Realm is like tenant in a keycloak server. It is a space that allows us to manage a set of users, their roles and
    their credentials.

2. Using "Add realm" button create one realm
3. From Manage section -> Users => Add new user
4. After adding users open that particular user -> goto "Credentials" tab and add password for that user.
5. After adding user goto http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/myfirstrealm/account and user credentials
    of created user and sign in.


-------------------------------------------
Method - 1 (Authorization Code)
-------------------------------------------


    For receving authorization code our client app must be registered with Authorization server to get
    client_id and client_secret eg.

    Client (Postman), Authorization Server (Keycloak)

    1. Goto KeyCloak admin console
    2. Select our realm not master one.
    3. From left hand side menu goto clients
    4. After it opens clients page click on "create" top right corner and add/register our client app
        in this case we are using Postman as our UI client.
    5. After adding client id click on save and our client application will be created.

    Note: By Default our created client "Access Type" will be public so we'll not see credentials page.
        So change it to Confidentials and save than we'll see Credentials page and than we'll get
        access token there.

    - Standard Flow Enabled (By default enabled) = Authorization code.
    - Direct Access Grant Enabled (By default enabled) = Password Grant.
    - Valid redirect url: provide our url for displaying page after successfull login and logout
        by default it will be KeyCloak url

*** Authorization Code Flow (This code will help to access resource server) ***

 GET: http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/myfirstrealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth

 Http request params:

    client_id:
    response_type: code // Don't change
    scope: openid profile
    redirect_uri: http://localhost:8083/callback
    state:

provide all these param with GET request in postman url will we formatted.
copy the url and open it in browser after successfull login we'll get the access code in url itself.

Copy the access code from above url


------------------------------------------------------------------
- Now Accessing the resource-server
------------------------------------------------------------------

    POST: http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/myfirstrealm/protocol/openid-connect/token

    Body: x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type:authorization_code
    client_id:
    client_secret:
    code:
    redirect_uri:http://localhost:8083/callback
    scope:openid profile

    After this you will receive access_token

    copy access_token and use in the headers section of resource-server url
